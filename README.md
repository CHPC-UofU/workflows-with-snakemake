# workflows-with-snakemake

This repository contains the slides, exercise files, and solutions to the
exercises for the Workflows with Snakemake presentation, presented by
Brett Milash of the Center for High Performance Computing, University of Utah.

To complete these exercises, log in to your CHPC account (or an account on
another SLURM cluster running Linux where snakemake and R are available)
and clone the repository with the commands:

module load git; git clone https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/workflows-with-snakemake.git

That will create the "workflows-with-snakemake" directory, where you will 
find the exercise files and solutions.
